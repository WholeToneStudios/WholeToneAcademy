          <h4>About</h4>
          <p><strong>Protest Choir Project</strong> is now active! All those who are Queer, Trans, and/or PoC: after your socially conscious Sunday afternoon activities or perhaps a much needed nap, come on over to the WholeTone Music Academy and magnify your voices! Alternatively, you can join us Tuesdays from 7-8:30pm and unwind after your work day. We'll continue learning how to be loud and proud without hurting ourselves in the process. You can look forward to some hands-on learning about body awareness at every session. Group voice lessons + slightly rowdy choir = Protest Choir Project. Pay-what-you-can $5-$25 but no one will be turned away for inability to pay. See you soon!</p>
